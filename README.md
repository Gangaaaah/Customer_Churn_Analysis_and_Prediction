📌 Project Summary

The goal was to analyze customer churn patterns, segment customers, and build predictive machine-learning models.

✅ Task 1 – Data Preparation

Loaded and explored the Telco customer dataset.

Cleaned missing and inconsistent values.

Converted categorical columns to numeric (manual mapping + one-hot encoding).

Converted TotalCharges to numeric and handled errors.

Split dataset into train (80%) and test (20%).

✅ Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated and visualized overall churn rate.

Analyzed customer distribution by gender, partner, dependents.

Explored tenure patterns and their relationship with churn.

Compared churn across contract types and payment methods.

✅ Task 3 – Customer Segmentation

Segmented customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.

Calculated churn within each segment.

Identified high-value customers at high risk of churning.

Saved risky customer group for further analysis.

✅ Task 4 – Model Training & Evaluation

Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.

Applied feature scaling and handled class imbalance.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

Analyzed feature importance to identify key churn drivers.
